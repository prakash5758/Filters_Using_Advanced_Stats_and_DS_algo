This repository contains multiple Python files to assist in the selection of analog wells by removing outliers. The key focus of this project is to identify wells that match certain characteristics, perform preprocessing, apply statistical tests, and remove outliers using the Mahalanobis distance technique. The final filters are applied to the many features:

## How it Works
The process starts by downloading well data from a PostgreSQL database, followed by preprocessing and filtering. A statistical test is applied and used advance DS techniques to filter the data based on multiple features.
